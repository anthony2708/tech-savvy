## How to use

### Current status

This section will display the current status of the monitored websites. This section provides two important information: the success response rate (**status code 200**) in **percentage** and the average response time in **milliseconds**. This status is updated continuously, and can be aggregated over **24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 365 days** and **All time**.

### Detailed information

When selecting each website, the corresponding detailed information will be displayed, including:

- The success response rate (**Status Code 200**) in percentage
- The average response time in milliseconds
- The response time in **the last 7 days**
- The **incidents** that occurred with that website

### Incidents

For ongoing incidents, the system will update the **latest information** to the system. For incidents that have occurred, the system will save and display them on the website **below the Current Status section**.
